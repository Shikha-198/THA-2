    <br/> Sub: Letter Asking Permission to Conduct Webinar
    </h5>
   <br/> Dear Sir/Madam,
   <br/> 
    <br/>I'm sending this letter to you for asking permission to conduct a webinar for all the students of our
    college. As you know there is less interaction between juniors and seniors because of virtual classes
    going on since last two yearsso it would be difficult for students to getguidance in righ direction 
    and for all of this I would like to invite the community member of Devsnest to organise a webinar.
 <br/>   
<br/> I was thinking if we can conduct a webinar in which they will be told about the company and 
    how to prepare for internship ,placements and how to develop skills and years after how to 
    get placed in good companies.Furthermore, this way they will also get a chance to socialize 
    with the other student which will help them in settling in. I have attached a draft which 
    contains the sequence of the segments in the webinar along with the date and the segmentâ€™s
     respective timing.
     <br>
    <br/>You may contact me for any further queries or clarification.
     <br/>
    <br/>I would be very grateful to you if you grant me permission to conduct the webinar.
    <br/>
   <br/> Best Regards,
    
   <br> Shikha
